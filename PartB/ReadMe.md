Work Distribution:

1. Sherlock holmes, IMDB : Prathyusha Gayam
2. Yelp, Gutenberg : Suma Dodmani - Worked on the implementation of getting Top 2000  
               Prathyusha Gayam - Worked on Optimizing the code for memory issues.
------

We have two jar files, one for the simple word count and the other for top 2000.  
Since the DataSet for Gutenberg and Yelp is huge, we had to add the sort function. Thus to accomodate these changes, we have created two separate JAR files.
